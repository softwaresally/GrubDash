As part of my Thinkful program, I was responsible for creating the server-side code for the already-completed frontend.
GrubDash is an application where the user can view and order dishes, similiar to UberEats. 
I was tasked with creating the backend code for this project, which handles creating, reading, updating, and listing dishes, as well as creating, reading, updating, listing, and deleting orders.

In this project, I used express routers and controllers, VS Code, error handlers, and listeners.
MY future goals for this project are to be able to connect the back end to the front end and really make this project come to life!
